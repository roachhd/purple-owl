Purple Owl is a clean and beautiful [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) based layout
for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own hackers style To Do list. It was
based on [zachholman's](http://zachholman.com/) blog themes: the "old" one, now
opensourced as [left](http://github.com/holman/left), and also in his actual
theme, that's not opensource (I believe), but I steal some ideas anyway. I also
took something from [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap),
and, of course, I'm using [bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) as
a base for all the thing. 
All credit to [caarlos0](http://github.com/caarlos0) for the beautiful UP Jekyll theme.

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Rename it to `To Do` or whatever you like!
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/To-Do`
- Run the jekyll server in the blog folder: `rake preview`.

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. 
- [_config.yml](https://github.com/roachhd/purple-owl/blob/master/_config.xml): Put
your config there, almost everything will be up and running.
## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`purple-owl`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com/purple-owl>.
